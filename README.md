Package Drone
=======

A package manager repository for Java (any maybe more)

This project was started to scratch the itch that Maven Tycho can compile OSGi bundles with Eclipse, but not deploy it "somewhere". Everything has to somehow copied around with B3, P2Director or other tools.

The idea is to have a workflow of Tycho Compile -> publish to repo -> Tycho Compile (using deployed artifacts). And some repository tools like cleanup, freezing, validation.

Also if you start a thing like this, it should somehow be extensible, since the next thing I would like to see it creating APT and YUM repositories.

Warning: This project is as its early stages. Try it out, find it useful or wait until it is stable enough to work for you.

What it currently can do
----------------

* Maven Tycho can deploy bundles and features (NOT repositories)
* Eclipse P2 can fetch bundles and features
* Store artifacts and metadata in a MariaDB (possibly MySQL) database
* P2 metadata can be used from Maven Tycho, or generated by Package Drone. This can be selected on a per channel basis.
* Automatically create P2 features from the list bundles in a channel
* Automatically create Eclipse Source Bundles from Maven source attachments

Known bugs and limitation
----------------

* The concept of P2 categories and binaries is missing
* Automatic cleanup is missing
* There is deadlock in Equinox/EclipseLink when updating the JPA database settings
* There is no security AT ALL
* PostgreSQL is not supported, since PostgreSQL does not support Blobs properly

What it currently cannot do
----------------

A lot of things. If there is time it will be implemented. Or you can help by contributing.

Hopefully some time package drone can:

* Provide access to bundles by an OBR layout
* Provide access to bundles by an OSGi R5 repository layout
* Act as a fully functional Maven M2 repository
